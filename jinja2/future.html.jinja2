                Medical Missions
                <p>We are always improving our medical missions. In 2014, we are going to start bring surgeons to perform procedures in local hospitals. This will allow patients to have access to necessary surgical procedures care and create partnerships and learning opportunities between Dominican and American surgeons.</p>

                Special Patients
                <p>Every time we go on a mission, we find patients who are in desperate need of help, but the Constanzan medical system simply canâ€™t provide what they need. For example, this May we met a family that all suffer from retinitis pigmentosa -- they are all blind. However, they live in a very dangerous home.  The only path to their home is rocky and uneven. They have memorized the path, but every time it rains, the path changes. We are raising money to refurbish their home and make it safe.</p>

                Water Project
                <p>The drinking water in Constanza is terribly polluted. Many children suffer from water-borne infections. In conjunction with Rotary, hundreds of water filters have been distributed to local families. With your support, we will be able to provide additional water filters to more deserving families.</p>
            </li>

                Dental Clinic
                <p>Dental care is very expensive in Constanza, so many people simply suffer with the pain of rotten teeth. During every mission, our dentists are forced to pull dozens of teeth. In 2014, we will provide financial and technical support to a new dental clinic in Constanza. "Dentist Dave", a volunteer dentist who has been on several mission, does dental procedures at our clinics and is integral to the planning of the new dental unit.</p>

                Improve the Hospital
                <p>The Constanza Hospital does not possess many rudimentary supplies. In the next few years, we are going to improve our partnership with them. The CMM will send more supplies and provide more training to the local professionals. Working together, we will make Constanza Hospital a much more effective health care provider.</p>
